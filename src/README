===============================================================================

*** Google cpp-btree: https://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/
Description:
The map data structure used by my KeyValueStore_server implementation uses a
Btree instead of Red Black tree. The Btree implementation uses less memory
and for big data access showed to be faster than Red Black tree (as it
improves the using of cache)

Files used:
btree.h
btree_container.h
btree_map.h
btree_set.h


Files location:
src\
(they should work if inserted in include\)


Compilation issues:
It was required to insert these lines in the makefile:
KeyValueStore_server.o: KeyValueStore_server.cpp
â†’       $(CXX) -Wall -std=c++0x -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H -DHAVE_NETINET_IN_H $(INC) -c $< -o $@

As this library requires to be compiled with flag c++0x
(former specification name used for c++11)
