                         =============================

I) External libraries used:
===============================================================================

*** Google cpp-btree: https://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/
Description:
The map data structure used by my KeyValueStore_server implementation uses a
Btree instead of Red Black tree. The Btree implementation uses less memory
and for big data access it showed to be faster than Red Black tree (as it
improves the using of cache)

Files used:
btree.h
btree_container.h
btree_map.h
btree_set.h


Files location:
src\
(they should work if inserted in include\)


Compilation issues:
It was required to insert these lines in the makefile:
KeyValueStore_server.o: KeyValueStore_server.cpp
â†’       $(CXX) -Wall -std=c++0x -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H -DHAVE_NETINET_IN_H $(INC) -c $< -o $@

As this library requires to be compiled with flag c++0x
(former specification name used for c++11)


II) Important Notes
================================================================================

a) KV Servers IDs
-----------------
I considered that kv server ids are assigned continuously from 0 to n-1, where n
is the number of KV servers.

b) KV Server input
-----------------
Each KV Server receives as parameter a list of other KV Servers. I consider that
all KV Server receives the same number of servers (and therefore create vectors
with the same size for their timestamps).

c) Tribble Posted attribute
-----------------------
It was converted to be just a number (as Lab2). This value may not be the same
for a post between different KV Store servers as they will solve a valid 
logical for.
I was allowed to change this according to this line in LAB3 description:
"The 'posted' field in the Tribble structure is now a list of integers as opposed
to a single integer value. This is provided so that you can send vector
imestamps to your Tribbler server, in case you need to.
***You should feel free to further redefine it if necessary.***"

III) Include Folder
================================================================================
The folder "include" is a copy of the include folder containing all Thrift 
generated headers and code files. This was required as I changed the RPC speci-
fication between KVStore servers (and the type of the Posted attribute of
Tribbler response type).
